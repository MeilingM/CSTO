<h1>Data Project: Check Your Chex</h1>
  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p>If you're a person who likes eating Chex, but hates soggy cereal, then this page is for you! I collected data
    that would help me make a recommendation for which type of Chex cereal you should buy to avoid it getting soggy. The problem was that 
    broken pieces get soggier faster, so I had to figure out which box had the strongest cereal pieces.</p>
