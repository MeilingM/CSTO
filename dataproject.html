<h1>Data Project: Check Your Chex</h1>
  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p class="p">If you're a person who likes eating Chex, but hates soggy cereal, then this page is for you! I collected data
    that would help me make a recommendation for which type of Chex cereal you should buy to avoid it getting soggy. The problem was that 
    broken pieces get soggier faster, so I had to figure out which box had the strongest cereal pieces that were less likely to break.</p>
  <h2>The data I collected</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The number of broken pieces in each type of Chex box before being shaken</li>
    <li>The number of broken pieces in each type of Chex box after being shaken a certain number of times</li>
    <li>Which was stronger: Corn, wheat, or rice</li>
    <li>The type of Chex that had the least percent of more broken pieces</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="p">I collected the first data type by sorting an unshaken Chex box's pieces into two piles: broken and intact. Then, I weighed
    each pile and got the percentage of pieces that were broken. I collected the second data type by shaking the box according to its number
    of servings. Then I repeated the process in data type 1. I collected the third data type by going online and researching. I found that wheat
    was the strongest. Finally, I collected data type four by graphing data types one and two. I looked for the Chex type which had the least 
    difference in broken pieces between the two boxes.</p>
