<h1>Data Project: Check Your Chex</h1>
  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p class="pg">If you're a person who likes eating Chex, but hates soggy cereal, then this page is for you! I collected data
    that would help me make a recommendation for which type of Chex cereal you should buy to avoid it getting soggy: Corn, rice, or wheat Chex. The problem was that 
    broken pieces get soggier faster, so I had to figure out which box had the strongest cereal pieces that were less likely to break.</p>
  <h2>The data I collected</h2>
  <ul class="normal">
<li>The number of broken Chex pieces when they are shaken a certain number of times</li>
    <li>The number of broken Chex pieces before they are shaken</li>
    <li>Which is stronger: Corn, wheat, or rice</li>
    <li>The type of Chex cereal with the least percent of more broken pieces between the two shaken and unshaken boxes</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="pg">I collected the first data type by sorting an unshaken Chex box's pieces into two piles: broken and intact. Then, I weighed
    each pile and got the percentage of pieces that were broken. I collected the second data type by shaking the box according to its number
    of servings. Then I repeated the process in data type 1. I collected the third data type by going online and researching. I found that wheat
    was the strongest. Finally, I collected data type four by graphing data types one and two. I looked for the Chex type which had the least difference in broken pieces between the two boxes.</p>
  <h2>Bad data</h2>
  <p class="pg">A few possible problems with the data I collected are:</p>
  <ul class="normal">
<li>I couldn't find Wheat Chex in the same size as Corn and Rice Chex. I fixed this problem by using weight as my measurement, rather than count.</li>
    <li>Every Chex box is different, so I might've gotten different results with a different box. Unfourtunately, I can't fix this because I don't have much control over how each box is handled before I buy it </li>
    <li>Some pieces were hard to sort, as a few of them were joined together and some were barely broken, but still dented. I fixed this problem by establishing a set of requirements for each pile</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p class="pg">Besides these few obstacles, I think I did a relatively good job keeping my data clean and accurate by double-checking my piles often 
    and taking care to not mix anything up.</p>
  <h2>My recommendation</h2>
  <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rR4QCRtrFTx9FsOU668D8D7zdHkhFkWVNGbLlarVjNA/pubchart?oid=773562576&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
  <p class="pg">I graphed the number of broken pieces in each box (data types one and two) on this bar graph. As you can see, Wheat Chex had the least difference in the shaken and unshaken boxes, proving that it was the strongest. In fact, 
    there were more broken pieces in the unshaken box, so I can conclude that Wheat Chex isn't affected by movement as much as the other two boxes. This result also 
    makes sense, as wheat in general is said to be stronger than corn or rice. I am using data type four as my recommendation: If you like Chex but hate soggy cereal, then Wheat Chex is for you!</p>
  <h2>Automation</h2>
  <p class="pg">I don't think my recommendation should be automated. Automation is good for things that change a lot, but my experiment 
    doesn't include things that change frequently. If I repeated this experiment, I would expect similar results, unless the Chex manufacturer starts
    to change things. Therefore, I think it would be useless to automate my recommendation as my experiment is more of a one-time thing. </p>
