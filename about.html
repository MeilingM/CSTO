    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>My life:</h2>
    <p class="p">I play the piano, and I'm a violinist in GTCYS (Greater Twin Cities Youth Symphonies). My favorite subject is math, but I also enjoy
      art class. I like drawing in my free time, and making crafts. I'm not going to tell you where I live, but I'll give you a hint: It's somewhere in this universe.
      I enjoy Minecraft, archery, sushi, coding, cats, origami, and cleaning my room. I think it's pretty obvious what my favorite color is by now. (Hint: What is the main color of this website?). 
      I also like stupid nerdy jokes. I would insert a science joke here, but all the good ones argon. :)</p>
    <h2>A bit more on my coding experience</h2>
    <p class="p">I know HTML, CSS, Python, and a bit of Java and JavaScript. I like coding websites like this one, but making apps are fun too. I also have a Scratch account, and have made many games and fun projects. 
    </p>
